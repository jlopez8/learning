# learning

This repo hosts multiple learning modules intended for Python, Machine Learning, and tools like Git.
The Machine Learning directory, for example has some notebooks reflecting my own notes on the course, while the assignments directory has my solution to the challenges presented in the course (course assignements.) Some content may be started by other creators, and I've either modified or implemented my own solutions to challenges presented.
